# This-Website-Is-Terrible

First project for the Code Institute Full Stack Developer course.

A tongue-in-cheek approach to a a mental health awareness website. The user transforms an intentionally bad website into a more positive and helpful one. In much the same way that pressure-washing a dirty patio is a cathartic and enjoyable experience, so too is the process of transforming this website into something better.

Features include:
- Swapping out text content
- Swapping out images
- Fixing colours
- Fixing layout
- adding useful links

Given the stage of the course, I have intentionally avoided the use of Javascript for this (excluding the Bootstrap library) so all interactivity is done through HTML and CSS only.

## Key Objectives

- Ultimately produce a visually clean and informative website
- responsive design at all times, irrespective of user-selected options
- showcase some advanced CSS techniques

## UX Design

### User Stories

- As a Site User, I want to navigate easily through the website so that I can find the information I need.
- As a Site User, I want to understand the goal of the website immediately upon arrival so that I can get a visual understanding of its purpose
- AS A visitor, I WANT TO access relevant external links SO THAT I CAN find additional resources and information on mental health and wellbeing.
- AS A visitor, I WANT TO read short paragraphs on simple mental health strategies SO THAT I CAN easily understand and implement them in my daily life.
- AS A user, I WANT TO subscribe to a newsletter SO THAT I CAN receive regular updates on mental health tips.
- AS a visitor, I WANT TO identify bad mental health strategies SO THAT I CAN understand the differences and make better choices for my wellbeing.
- AS a visitor, I WANT TO see highlights of good and bad website design for mental wellbeing SO THAT I CAN understand the impact of design choices on user experience and mental health.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq and can be found here: TODO

## Imagery

For the "good" version of the page, I utilised Dall-E to create a series of low-poly images of relaxing scenery. I felt this was most approporiate as it avoids the uncanny valley of generating images of real people or real settings.

For the "bad" version of the page, Dall-E was used to create images that were intentionally jarring and unpleasant. This was to create a stark contrast between the two versions of the page. In this process I have discovered that Dall-E will suspend my account if I generate images it feels may possibly be offensive.

I was banned for the following images:
- a clown sharpening its teeth
- a dumpster fire in a serene setting

I also discovered that Dall-E will simply refuse to generate images of meat. Instead it will generate images of fruit or vegetables.


## Content

All text-content was written by ChatGPT and edited by myself. The text was generated in a single pass and then edited for clarity and relevance.

I could not simply ask ChatGPT to generate the text for the "bad" version of the website as it tries very hard not to give incorrect or harmful advice, instead I had to trick it by feeding it the "good" version and asking it to provide the opposite advice.

Relevant external links were generated by https://www.perplexity.ai/ and edited for relevance. I found that ChatGPT had a tendency to simply make them up.
